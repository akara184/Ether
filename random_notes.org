#+TITLE: SOME RANDOM THOUGHTS ABOUT *******


* Some thoughts about C and C++ pointers
** C++ and C, difference of & and *

- & -> "the address of"
- * -> "what's at

#+begin_src C++ 
  int x;    // Declares x as having type int.
  int y;    // Declares y as having type int.
  int *p;   // Declares *p as having type int, which means that p has type pointer-to-int.

  p = &x;   // Uses & to get a pointer to x, and stores it in p. p now contains the value &x.
            // We say that "p points to x". In other words, *p is x.
  x = 10;   // Sets the value of the variable x to be 10.
  y = *p;   // Gets the value 10 from x through the pointer p and stores in y. y is now 10.
  ,*p = 42; // x is now 42, and y is still 10.
  p = &y;   // Set p to point to y instead. *p is now y.
  x = *p;   // x is now 10 again.

#+begin_src C++
int numero = 100;
int *ponteiro = &numero;

cout << numero;        // Output: 100
cout << &numero;       // Output: 0x7fff5fbff6ac (endereço)
cout << ponteiro;      // Output: 0x7fff5fbff6ac (mesmo endereço)
cout << *ponteiro;     // Output: 100 (valor no endereço)n

* Some thoughts about curried function and high-order function
 - A *higher-order* function is simply a function that takes a function as an
   argument or returns a function as a result, and /it may or may not be curried/.
 - A curried function, on the other hand, is one that /returns/ a function as its result
* Some thoughts about \to
A \to B 
Existe uma função que transforma valores do tipo A
em valores do tipo B.
